# Loc Lab (ll) Readme

Loc Lab is my own implementation of Casey Muratori's brilliant [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org) series in C. I'm using this project to establish a professional workflow that I will use for later personal projects.
Loc Lab is licensed under the zlib license. Check the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more information.

# Obtaining
Go to [ll releases](https://github.com/OutbackMan/LocLab/releases) and download the binary for your appropriate OS.

# Contributing
As this is a personal project, I will not accept any outside changes. The [CONTRIBUTING file](CONTRIBUTING.md) is merely included for the purposes of creating a professional workflow as outlined above.
